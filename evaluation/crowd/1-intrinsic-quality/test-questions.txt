788042779: 3/4/5
788042780: remove => ideally I should avoid using as test question instances for which the positive/negative decision is not clear
788042781: 1 => clearly irrelevant, cannot be anything else
788042782: 3/4/5 => this is definitely a positive even if there if the grammar is incorrect
788042784: 3/4/5 => this is definitely a positive

788042790: 3/4/5 => this is definitely a positive
788043746: 3/4/5 => this is definitely a positive [definitely keep this one since it requires basic inference on the location]
788057186: 1 => no data available, keep this one (and only one like this)
788057488: 3/4/5 => this is definitely a positive [disabled]
