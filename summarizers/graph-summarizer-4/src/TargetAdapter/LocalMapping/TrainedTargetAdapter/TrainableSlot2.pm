# CURRENT : what is the objective function ?
# => We want to maximize compatibility with the ground truth and maximize distance to the negative ground truth => how ?
# => (Max) Margin approaches => convexity ?

# Max margin is on the ...
# compatibility between a replacement filler and 
# => as a ranking problem ?

# => constraints ?
# => discriminative training of the scoring function ? how ?

# we're looking at the refilling function => does it even make sense to consider alternatives for the reference filler ? only in the sense the that reference filler should be the best replacement for the ... if we turn things around ? how do we do this ?
